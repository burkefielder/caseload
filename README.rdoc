This is a simple app designed to help speech pathologists keep track of their caseloads.

The goal is to have the following features and functions:
-- A list of students and their demographic information
-- A list of therapy notes for each student
-- A way to track IEP dates and service hours

The project is under construction and changing constantly. Check back often for updates.
